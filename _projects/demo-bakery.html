title: Layered Cake Co
case: A project that focuses on a small boutique has decided to find a way to limit the back-and-forth emails they are getting daily. By focusing on displaying their product online, customers can make more detailed inquiries, ultimately resulting in quicker bookings. Personalisation is everything to the team and want to make sure they can still communicate directly with clients to close the booking.
solution:  By featuring optimised images of their product, an information page with pricing details, and an explanation of the ordering system; clients can easily complete a detailed contact form that allows for swift responses from the team.
