title: The Cafe Project
case: This personal project aims to support an established cafe, that has done some recent updates to their cafe and want to show their presence in the community. The Cafe is known for its bright open space close to the beach where locals regularly come in for their daily coffees and meals. 
solution:  The final 4-page website highlights their story, and how they source ingredients, all while ensuring that the main information remains front and center. Animations reflect the engaging cafe environment. The menu displays their amazing new dishes and lets you filter items by drinks, desserts, or mains. A chat icon allows people to have a quicker way of comminicating with the cafe.
