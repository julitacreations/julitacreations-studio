title: Fresh 'n Wild
case: The project showcases the new website for a local restaurant and catering business that has been steadily expanding over the past few years. Designed in collaboration with the graphic designer, the website offers a fresh look while showcasing their growing services, both in the main restaurant and their expanding coffee shops. It features a streamlined catering contact form, making it easier for customers to inquire about events and catering services and making it easier for the team to capture the neccessary details to quickly get back to inquiries.
solution: We would never have the time to take the time to sit down and plan out every single detail (...) as Tatjana has done. Her international hospitality experience provided us with valuable insights, from assisting with training, new concept ideas & implementation (...) and simply being able to have more time to go on a holiday! The ease of working with Tatjana is every restaurant owner's dream. - Vanessa
